# Vomitorium

A simple handler for dynamically generating plists and serving IPAs based off reading the IPA context and contents.

Has a datamapper handler for managing IPAs. Can easily support uploading IPAs with versioning either through an API or something similar.

FFS I fucking hate xcode and enterprise dev.
